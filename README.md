# Classification Projects

This repository contains several classification projects implemented using machine learning algorithms. The projects aim to predict outcomes based on various datasets. Each project focuses on a unique problem, and the goal is to apply different classification models to achieve accurate predictions.

## Projects Overview

1. **Diabetes Prediction**  
   This project predicts whether a patient has diabetes based on medical diagnostic features such as age, glucose level, blood pressure, insulin level, etc. The project uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes Database**.

2. **MNIST Classification**  
   This project involves classifying handwritten digits using the **MNIST dataset**, which contains images of handwritten numbers from 0 to 9. The project leverages deep learning techniques to classify the digits.

3. **Maternal Healthcare Classification**  
   This project focuses on predicting maternal health outcomes, such as complications during pregnancy, using healthcare data. The model aims to predict potential risks and help in maternal healthcare management.

## Datasets

### 1. Diabetes Prediction
- **Dataset**: [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- **Features**: Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age
- **Target**: Outcome (1 = Diabetes, 0 = No Diabetes)

### 2. MNIST Classification
- **Dataset**: [MNIST Database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
- **Features**: Images of handwritten digits (28x28 pixels)
- **Target**: Digits (0 to 9)

### 3. Maternal Healthcare Classification
- **Dataset**: Maternal healthcare dataset (custom dataset or sourced from healthcare repositories)
- **Features**: Age, Number of pregnancies, Blood Pressure, Blood Sugar, Heart Rate, etc.
- **Target**: Outcome (Risk of complications: Yes or No)

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Google Colab** (for running notebooks)
- **Libraries**:
  - **pandas** (for data manipulation)
  - **numpy** (for numerical operations)
  - **scikit-learn** (for machine learning models)
  - **tensorflow/keras** (for deep learning models, especially in MNIST classification)
  - **matplotlib** & **seaborn** (for data visualization)

## How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/classification.git
cd classification
```

### 2. Install dependencies
Each project has its own `requirements.txt` file. Install the dependencies for each project by navigating into the respective directory and running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the notebooks
Open the Jupyter notebook or Google Colab notebook for the respective project and run the cells sequentially. For example, for the diabetes prediction project:
```bash
cd diabetes_prediction
jupyter notebook diabetes_prediction.ipynb
```

Alternatively, open the notebook in **Google Colab**:
1. Upload the notebook to your Google Drive.
2. Open it with Google Colab.
